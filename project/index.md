General notes and suggestions for customizing **HPSTR**.

## Basic Setup for a new Jekyll site

1. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and then install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork the [HPSTR Jekyll Theme repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/fork).
3. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

<div markdown="0"><a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/archive/master.zip" class="btn">Download the Theme</a></div>

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.

## Setup for an Existing Jekyll site

1. Clone the following folders: `_includes`, `_layouts`, '_sass', `assets`, and `images`.
2. Clone the following folders/files and personalize content as need: `about/`, `posts/`, `tags/`, `feed.xml`. and 'index.html'.
3. Set the following variables in your `config.yml` file:

{% highlight yaml %}
title:            Site Title
description:      Describe your website here.
disqus_shortname: shortname
# Your site's domain goes here (eg: //mmistakes.github.io, http://mademistakes.com, etc)
# When testing locally leave blank or use http://localhost:4000
url:              //mmistakes.github.io

# Owner/author information
owner:
  name:           Your Name
  avatar:         avatar.jpg
  bio:            "Your bio goes here. It shouldn't be super long but a good two sentences or two should suffice."
  email:          you@email.com
  # Social networking links used in footer. Update and remove as you like.
  twitter:        
  facebook:       
  github:         
  stackexchange:  
  linkedin:       
  instagram:      
  flickr:         
  tumblr:         
  # For Google Authorship https://plus.google.com/authorship
  # google plus id, include the '+', eg +mmistakes
  google_plus:    +yourid

# Analytics and webmaster tools stuff goes here
google_analytics:   
google_verify:      
# https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownership Option 2 content= goes here
bing_verify:         

# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
timezone:    America/New_York
future:      true
pygments:    true
markdown:    kramdown

# Amount of posts to show on home page
paginate: 5
{% endhighlight %}

## Running Jekyll

If `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` throw errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundled exec` instead.

> In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.
>
>However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.

{% highlight text %}
bundle exec jekyll build

bundle exec jekyll serve

## Customization

Most of the variables found here are used in the .html files found in `_includes` if you need to add or remove anything. A good place to start would be to add the `title`, `description`, and `url` for your site. Links are absolute and prefixed with `{{ "{{ site.url " }}}}` in the various `_includes` and `_layouts`, so remember to properly set `url`[^1] to `http://localhost:4000` when developing locally.

### Disqus Comments

Create a [Disqus](http://disqus.com) account and change `disqus_shortname` in `_config.yml` to the Disqus *shortname* you just setup. By default comments appear on all post and pages if you assigned a shortname. To disable commenting on a post or page, add the following to its YAML Front Matter:

{% highlight yaml %}
comments: false
{% endhighlight %}

### Social Share Links

To enable Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ share links on a post or page, add the following to its front matter:

{% highlight yaml %}
share: false
{% endhighlight %}

### Owner/Author Information

Change your name, and avatar photo (200x200 pixels or larger), email, and social networking URLs. If you want to link to an external image on Gravatar or something similar you'll need to edit the path in `head.html` since it assumes it is located in `/images`.

Including a link to your Google+ profile has the added benefit of displaying [Google Authorship](https://plus.google.com/authorship) in Google search results if you've went ahead and applied for it.

### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Your Google Analytics ID goes here along with meta tags for [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownershi) site verification.

### Navigation Links

To add additional links in the drop down menu edit `_data/navigation.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window.*

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Portfolio
  url: /portfolio/

- title: Made Mistakes
  url: http://mademistakes.com
{% endhighlight %}
